This repository documents my very first hands-on experience with **Nmap** (Network Mapper) as part of authorized red team / ethical hacking training.

The goal is to build muscle memory with basic-to-intermediate scanning techniques in a controlled, legal lab environment.

All thanks to @parocyber on linkedIn

ensured nmap is installed 

Realized i am not on the preferred network for the ethical hacking cours; decided to make good use of the knowledge gained and practice. i will not always be spoon fed. performed a simple nmap scan
